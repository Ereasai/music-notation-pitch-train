# Music Notation Pitch Trainer
Created by Gunwoo Kim during Winter 2022.
## Motivation
I am very bad at reading music. It takes me a long time to just figure out where the notes are. So, I wanted to gameify the process of learning and created this app. 

Another technical motivation was to learn how to develop a SPA (single page application). I am only aware of the premise of this format, so the implementation will be not the most ideal.
## Premise
* light-weight application that trains you to identify pitch in western notation.
* should be used along side with a piano.
* clean interface.
## Other comments
* most likely won't be updated or maintained after the basic features are done.
